# Permissions-Breakdown-on-the-HR-Directory
Permissions Breakdown:

    Owner (User): Full access (read, write, and execute)
    Group: Full access (read, write, and execute)
    Others: No access

Effects of chmod 770 on the HR Directory:

    Owner (User): The owner of the HR directory can:
        View the contents of the directory.
        Create, delete, or modify files within the directory.
        Enter and execute files inside the directory.

    Group: Any user who is part of the group associated with the HR directory has the same permissions as the owner:
        View, create, delete, or modify files.
        Enter and execute files inside the directory.

    Others: Users who are not the owner or part of the group cannot:
        Access, view, or perform any operations within the HR directory.

Implications:

    This permission setup is typically used in environments where the directory needs to be accessible and modifiable by a team (group members) but kept private from other users on the system.
    For example, sensitive HR documents like EmployeePolicy.doc and Candidates.csv would only be visible and manageable by the HR team and the directory owner.
